# Design Principles
1. SOLID principles are the foundation on which we can build clean, maintainable architectures.
2. SOLID principles are more effective when they applied together.

## Code Fragility
Fragility is the tendency of the software to break in many places every time it is changed.

## Code Rigidity
Rigidity is the tendency for software to be difficult to change, even in simple ways.
Every change causes a cascade of subsequent changes in dependent modules.

### Caution
Rigidity and Fragility are symptoms of high technical debt. 
We can avoid this by using SOLID principles

## Technical Debt
The cost of prioritizing fast delivery over code quality for long periods of time.

### Technical Debt Facts
1. No matter how good the team is, technical debt will accumulate over time
2. Left uncontrolled, it will kill your project
3. The key is to keep it under control

### Controlling Technical Debt
1. Write code
2. Pay debt (refactor)
3. Write more
4. Pay debt (refactor)
5. Continue last 2 steps

## SOLID Principles
1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

### Top Benefits of SOLID Code
1. Easy to understand and reason out
2. Changes are faster and have a minimal risk level
3. Highly maintainable over long periods of time
4. Cost effective

### Other Ways to Keep Architecture Clean
1. Constant Refactoring
2. Design Patterns
3. Unit Testing(TDD)

### Pyramid of Clean Code
* Continuous refactoring
* TDD
* Design patterns
* SOLID
